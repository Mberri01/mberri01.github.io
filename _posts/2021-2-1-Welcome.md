I am a 2nd year student studying chemistry at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo. Currently I am involved in the [Kantorowski research lab](https://chemistry.calpoly.edu/content/faculty/kantorowski_eric) on campus. I have participated in the Frost Program on campus and will be a Frost Scholarship recipient in the spring. Chemistry's applications as you can tell are very important to me, click on to learn more!
