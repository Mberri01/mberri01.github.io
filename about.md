Upon graduating from Orcutt Academy High School in Santa Maria California, Meekaela Berrios chose to further her education at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo studying chemistry. Within her first two years at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Meekaela joined the Kantorowski Research group to apply the knowledge learned from class to a lab setting. The project Meekaela was aiding the Kantorowski with included looking at the individual kinetics and competitive kinetics of cyclopropane ring openings with different subistiuents in order to create a basis or jumping point for other pharmaceutical based research. Now there are several branches of this project being explored with specific subsitutents and neighboring cyclic groups and how that impacts the ring opening.
