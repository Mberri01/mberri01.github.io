Here are some of Meekaela's Hobbies! She loves feedback so leave a comment below if you have any cool additions on where you think she should explore next!

1. Meekaela is a hiking enthusiast. She hopes to work her way up to hike longer and harder hikes in California like those in Yosemite National park within the near future. However, at the moment she is greatful for the beauty and hiking accesibility the central coast has to offer. Here are pictures from two of her recent hikes. One was taken locally from Madonna Mountain looking at the sister mountain known as Bishop's Peak <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/20210626_104911.jpg" alt="Bishops" width="250" style="float: left; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 10px" />  Farther down south Meekaela has also ventured into the hills of Santa Barbara. Her favorite thing about hiking is the peace that nature brings to a normally chaotic life. The beauty of our world is just inspiring and refreshing <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/20210501_115647.jpg" alt="SB" width="300"g" alt="Bishops" width="250"style="float: right; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 10px" />
